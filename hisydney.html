  <p>Despite its name, the orca whale is actually a type of dolphin. They can be recognized by their black coloring with white splotches, which has given them the nickname "blackfish".</p>
  <p>Like other types of dolphins, orcas are extremely social. They congregate in pods consisting of many members of the same family, and will remain with the same pod for their entire life.</p>
  <p>Orcas are carnivores, and may hunt fish, seals, and adolescent whales. Orcas do not hunt humans. There has never been a recorded case of a wild orca attacking a human, although captive orcas have occasionally attacked their trainers out of frustration.</p>
