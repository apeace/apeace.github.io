		<h2>Open-source</h2>

		<p>At Ride.com, I open-sourced by Device Farm CLI: <a href="https://github.com/ride/devicefarm">devicefarm</a></p>

		<p>As a fun experiment to play with TypeScript, I wrote a tic-tac-toe solver: <a href="https://github.com/apeace/tictac.ts">tictac.ts</a></p>

		<p>I'm proud to be proactive about finding, fixing, and pull-requesting bugs or
			missing features in open-source libraries I use. Thus I have contributed several
			small fixes to the open-source community:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/pull/336">Engine.io PR #336</a> -
				Fixes a Socket.io resource leak that can be catastrophic when connections frequently open and close
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/request/request/pull/146">request PR #146</a> -
				Fixes mishandling of content-type setting for multipart POST requests
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jfhbrook/node-sendgrid-web/pull/4">node-sendgrid-web PR #4</a> -
				Fixes a socket hangup when sending a long email to Sendgrid
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/flatiron/director/pull/65">director PR #65</a> -
